    <p>Lazy loading can be achieved very easily by using <code>loading="lazy"</code>. Then you can also use htmz logic
        to
        set a target element for the loaded content!</p>
    <a href="lazy.php#content">Load content</a>

        <i>Note: there is a <s>bug</s> feature in Firefox where hidden iframes won't lazy load. For this reason, we hide
            the
            iframe by setting height and opacity at 0</i>
